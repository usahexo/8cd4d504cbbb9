#  How to Survey Gambling Losses in 2017 Blackjack Lobby 

Your taxes are due in a few months and you're wondering just how much money you lost gambling last year. You're not alone. Taxpayers loses billions of dollars each year on gambling, but there's good news: there are ways to estimate your losses without needing to track every penny. This guide will show you how to do just that. 

The IRS generally allows taxpayers to deduct their gambling losses up to the amount of their winnings. So, if you won $1,000 at the casino but lost $1,500, your deduction would be limited to $1,000. If you didn't keep track of your wins and losses separately, you can still estimate your deduction by calculating your average losses for the year. To do this, add up all of your losses for the year - including amounts lost at blackjack, poker, roulette, and any other form of gambling - and divide by the number of months in the year. This will give you your average monthly loss. 

Let's say you calculate that your average monthly loss is $100. Multiply this by 12 months to get an annual loss of $1,200. You can then subtract this amount from your total winnings for the year to arrive at your taxable gambling income for the year. In our example above, this would leave a taxable gambling income of $800. 

Keep in mind that there are other factors that the IRS takes into consideration when determining whether or not a gambling loss is deductible. For instance, you can only deduct losses against income made from wagers placed in connection with a trade or business. So, if you're a professional gambler, most of your losses would not be deductible. And finally, if you itemize deductions on your tax return, gambling losses may be limited depending on the amount of other itemized deductions claimed. 

Despite these limitations, though, most taxpayers will be able to claim some deduction for their gambling losses in 2017. So don't be afraid to take that trip to Vegas - as long as you keep track of what goes down at the tables!

#  How to Analyze Your Gambling Losses in 2017 Blackjack Lobby

There are a few different ways to analyze your gambling losses in 2017, but to do so effectively you need to understand what the different metrics mean. In this article, we’ll take a look at three of the most important ones: time betting, average bet size and amount wagered.

Time Betting

This metric is simply the amount of time you spent gambling in total during the year. This can be useful for understanding how much time you’ve been dedicating to gambling and whether that’s sustainable or not. If you’re spending more time than you’d like gambling, it might be time to set some limits or quit altogether.

Average Bet Size

The average bet size is another important metric to look at when analyzing your gambling losses. This tells you how much money you’re risking on average per bet. If your average bet size is high, it means that you could be losing a lot of money quickly if things go bad. Conversely, if your average bet size is low, it means that your bankroll should last for a longer period of time.

Amount Wagered

Finally, the amount wagered metric lets you know how much money you’ve risked overall in 2017. This is perhaps the most important statistic to look at when evaluating your gambling losses, as it tells you how much money could potentially be lost if things go wrong. Ideally, this number should be lower than what you’ve actually lost, as that would indicate that you’ve been making smart bets and minimizing your risks.

Are you one of the many people that like to gamble when you aren't working? If so, there are a couple of key things that you need to do in order to make sure that your gambling losses don't get out of control.
