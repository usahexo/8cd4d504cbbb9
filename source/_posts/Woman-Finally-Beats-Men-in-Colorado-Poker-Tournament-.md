#  Woman Finally Beats Men in Colorado Poker Tournament 

For the first time in Colorado history, a woman has won a major poker tournament. 31-year old Kathy Liebert overcame a field of 237 entries to take down the $2,100 buy-in Ladies Event at the Ameristar Casino in Black Hawk.

Liebert's only previous major win was in a smaller $220 buy-in ladies event at the M Resort Spa Casino in Las Vegas last year. In that tournament, she bested a field of 521 women players to take home the $10,735 first prize.

This latest victory netted her a much larger paycheck of $26,855 and finally saw her vanquish all male challengers after years of coming close. In 2004, for example, she finished runner-up to Alan Goehring in the World Series of Poker (WSOP) $5,000 no limit hold'em event - one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world.

In an interview after her latest victory, Liebert said: "I feel great! I've come close a few times against men in big tournaments but never managed to win. It feels awesome to finally break through."

When asked how it felt to be the first woman ever to win such a prestigious tournament in Colorado, she added: "It's really cool. I know there are some other women out there who can definitely compete with the best men players, so I'm really proud to have been able to do this and set a new standard."

#  Colorado Springs Casino Goes All In on Poker Tournaments 

There’s a new casino in town, and it’s going all in on poker tournaments.

The Colorado Springs Casino is the latest establishment to offer competitive Texas Hold’em action, and players are already raving about the quality of the games and the value of the promotions.

In addition to a variety of cash games, the casino is hosting a series of tournaments with buy-ins ranging from $50 to $200. The final event, a $1,000 buy-in tournament, is scheduled for November 11th.

All tournaments offer generous prize pools, with the winner taking home at least $2,500.

The casino has also partnered with some of the top poker rooms in the industry to offer players even more opportunities to win big. Players can qualify for major events like the World Series of Poker (WSOP) and the PokerStars Caribbean Adventure (PCA) through satellites hosted by these rooms.

So far, response to the new Colorado Springs Casino has been overwhelmingly positive. Players are excited about the value that is on offer and the high quality of competition that is available.

#  Are Poker Tournaments in Colorado a Bust for Casinos? 

While poker tournaments are popular around the country, it seems that they have not been as successful for casinos in Colorado. One reason may be because there is no real ordinance regulating these tournaments. The Colorado Gambling Commission has stated that poker tournaments are not considered gambling and therefore do not fall under their regulatory umbrella. This lack of oversight could lead to potential problems for casinos, as there is no guarantee that the players are actually following the rules of the game.

In addition, the commission has also said that it does not have any authority to investigate or punish casinos if something goes wrong with a tournament. This leaves casinos without any protection if something goes wrong. There have already been a few instances where players have refused to payout money that they won during a tournament, and the casino was unable to do anything about it.

There are some benefits to having poker tournaments in Colorado casinos. They can attract new players to the casino, and they can also help keep regular players coming back. However, if nothing is done to regulate these tournaments, it seems that they will continue to be a bust for casinos in the state.

#  poker tournaments in colorado - a game changer for the casino industry? 

The regulated poker tournament industry is booming in Colorado, with new tournaments being added regularly. The legalization of gambling in the state has led to casino companies investing heavily in the expansion of their poker tournament operations. And for good reason - poker tournaments are proving to be a huge game changer for the casino industry.

The popularity of poker tournaments can be traced back to the televised World Series of Poker, which began airing in the late 1990s. The WSOP became a ratings success, and launched the poker craze that continues to this day. With more people interested in playing poker, casinos started offering poker tournaments as a way to attract customers.

Today, poker tournaments are one of the most popular forms of gambling. They offer both novice and experienced players a chance to compete against each other while also providing plenty of excitement and drama. Poker tournaments are also very lucrative for casinos, as they attract high-stakes players who are willing to risk large sums of money.

Colorado has been quick to capitalize on the popularity of poker tournaments, with dozens of new tournaments being added in recent years. Some of the largest and most popular tournaments are offered by Caesars Entertainment Corporation, which operates three casinos in Colorado - Harrah's Casino & Hotel Black Hawk, Harrah's Lake Charles Casino & Hotel, and Horseshoe Southern Indiana Casino & Hotel.

Caesars offers several different types of poker tournaments, including Sit & Go's (single table), Shootouts (multi-table), and Deep Stack (high chip stack). They also have a variety of buy-in levels, making them accessible to players with all levels of bankrolls. And thanks to live streaming technology, players can watch all the action from their computer or mobile device.

Other casino companies are getting into the act as well. Station Casinos offers several regional poker tourneys throughout Colorado, while Monarch Casino Black Hawk hosts several large events that draw players from all over the country.

So what's driving all this interest in Colorado poker tournaments? There are several factors at work here. For one thing, Colorado has always been a popular tourist destination, thanks to its natural beauty and diverse landscape. The addition of legal gambling has only boosted tourism numbers further, as visitors flock to the state's casinos to try their luck at the tables or slots.

Poker tournaments are also growing in popularity because they offer an excellent competitive experience for players of all skill levels. Novice players can compete against others with similar skills and experience levels, while more experienced players can test their skills against some of the best competition in the world. This makes for an exciting and unpredictable gaming experience that keeps players coming back for more.

Finally, Colorado's legalized gambling industry is providing much-needed revenue for the state government. This money is used to support important programs and services such as education and public safety initiatives. So not only do poker tournaments provide a fun and exciting entertainment experience for casino guests, but they also help support vital state programs that benefit all residents

#  $1 Million Guaranteed Poker Tournament Coming to Denver

The Colorado Poker Tour has announced that it will be hosting a $1 million guaranteed poker tournament at the end of this year. The event is scheduled to take place at the Aces & Eights Poker Club in Denver from December 1-4.

"We are very excited to be able to offer this big event to the poker community in Denver," said the tour's founder, Ryan Teng. "It's going to be a great opportunity for players of all levels to compete for a share of $1 million."

The CPT has been running tournaments throughout Colorado for the past few years, and this upcoming event is shaping up to be its biggest yet. Players can buy in directly for $1,000 or qualify through one of several online satellites that are being offered.

The prize pool is expected to be divided among the top 200 finishers, with the eventual winner taking home a minimum prize of $100,000. In addition, there will also be side events taking place throughout the four-day tournament, including a Ladies Event and a $10,000 High Roller tournament.

This is not only great news for Colorado poker players but also for the city of Denver as a whole. The CPT has stated that it plans on making this an annual event, and that could definitely help put Denver on the map as one of America's top destinations for poker players.
