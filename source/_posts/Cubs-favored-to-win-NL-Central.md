#  Cubs favored to win NL Central

The Cubs are the team to beat in the National League Central division this season. They are the favorites to win the division, and they should be able to make it all the way to the World Series.

The Cubs have a very talented roster, and they are led by manager Joe Maddon. They have a lot of firepower offensively, and they also have a solid pitching staff.

The Cardinals and Pirates are both teams that could give the Cubs a challenge this season, but I think the Cubs will ultimately come out on top. They are poised for another deep playoff run, and I expect them to win the NL Central division.

#  Brewers making a run at the division

The Milwaukee Brewers are making a strong run at the National League Central Division this year. If they can keep up the momentum, they have a good chance of winning the division and heading to the playoffs.

The Brewers got off to a slow start this season, but they have been playing very well lately. They have won their last six games, and they are now in second place in the division, just two games behind the first-place Cubs.

Brewers manager Craig Counsell has been doing a great job with his team. He has been using a lot of different lineups and rotations, and it seems to be working well.

Most of the Brewersâ€™ offense is coming from their stars, such as Christian Yelich and Lorenzo Cain. But they are getting contributions from all over the roster, which is making them a very tough team to beat.

Their starting pitching has also been impressive. Rookie Brandon Woodruff has been a big surprise, and veteran Jhoulys Chacin has been consistent all season. If they can continue to pitch well, the Brewers will be in good shape for the rest of the season.

The Brewers still have some tough opponents ahead of them, but if they can keep playing like they have been lately, they have a good chance of winning the division and heading to the playoffs.

#  Pirates and Cardinals in a tight race

The Pirates and Cardinals find themselves in a tight race for the NL Central division as we approach the All-Star break. The two teams are neck and neck in the standings, with the Pirates currently holding a half-game lead.

This race is a bit of a surprise to many, as the Cardinals were expected to dominate this division. But the Pirates have been playing very well, thanks in part to their young stars like Andrew McCutchen and Gerrit Cole.

The Cardinals have been led by veterans like Yadier Molina and Carlos Beltran. But they have also gotten strong performances from rookie phenoms like Michael Wacha and Shelby Miller.

It should be an exciting second half of the season as these two teams battle it out for first place. Who will come out on top?

#  Cubs still looking like the favorites

The Cubs have been the class of the National League all season long, and they still look like the favorites to win the World Series.

Chicago has a great starting rotation, led by Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester. They also have a strong lineup, headlined by Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo.

The Dodgers are the only team that can really compete with the Cubs in the National League. L.A. has an impressive starting rotation of their own, led by Clayton Kershaw. But their lineup is not as strong as Chicago's, and they may not be able to match up with the Cubs in a seven-game series.

The Royals are the only team that can compete with the Cubs in terms of overall talent. But Kansas City is coming off a disappointing season, and it's unclear if they have what it takes to win it all this year.

In the end, the Cubs should be able to overcome any challengers and win their first World Series since 1908.

#  Who will take the NL Central crown?

This year's NL Central race is shaping up to be one of the most exciting in baseball. The defending World Champion Cubs are still the favorites, but they'll have to contend with a revamped Cardinals squad and a Brewers team that made some big moves this offseason. Let's take a closer look at each team in the division and see who has the best chance of taking home the crown.

The Cubs are still the team to beat in the NL Central. They have one of the best lineups in baseball and a rotation led by Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester. However, they did lose some key players this offseason, including Dexter Fowler, Aroldis Chapman, and Travis Wood. They'll need players like Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo, and Kyle Schwarber to step up and fill the voids left by those departures.

The Cardinals made a lot of moves this offseason in an effort to compete with the Cubs. They acquired shortstop Paul DeJong, outfielder Dexter Fowler, and starting pitcher Miles Mikolas. They also signed reliever Brett Cecil to a four-year deal. Their lineup is now very deep and they have some great young pitchers in their rotation, including Carlos Martinez and Alex Reyes.

The Brewers had a busy offseason as well, signing Lorenzo Cain and Christian Yelich to big contracts. They also acquired starting pitcher Chase Anderson and reliever Matt Albers. Their lineup is now very potent and they have one of the best bullpens in baseball. However, their pitching staff is still somewhat suspect and they'll need guys like Ryan Braun and Eric Thames to continue performing at a high level if they want to compete with the Cubs and Cardinals.

In my opinion, the Cubs are still the team to beat in the NL Central. They have more talent than anyone else in the division and I don't think there's any question that they'll win their fourth consecutive division title. However, I do think that it will be much closer this year than it has been in previous years and there will be several teams competing for second place behind Chicago.
