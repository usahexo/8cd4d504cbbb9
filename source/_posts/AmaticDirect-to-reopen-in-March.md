#  AmaticDirect casino set to reopen soon with improved security

Casino operators have been on high alert recently, as a number of well-known brands have become the target of cybercriminals. In response to this, many operators are taking steps to improve their security measures. One such casino is AmaticDirect, which is set to reopen its doors soon with improved security in place.

AmaticDirect Casino was forced to close its doors in early 2018 after it fell victim to a cyber attack. The casino has now confirmed that it will reopen soon, with a number of new security measures in place. These include enhanced firewalls and anti-virus protection, as well as additional controls on user access.

In a statement, the casino operator said: “We recognise that our players are our top priority and we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure their safety and security when playing at AmaticDirect Casino. We apologise for any inconvenience caused by the closure of our site and we look forward to welcoming our players back soon.”

The AmaticDirect Casino breach came just weeks after another major casino suffered a similar attack. The hacking group known as “Russian Troll Factory” targeted Liberty Slots Casino, stealing player data and causing significant financial damage. It is believed that this group is behind a number of other attacks on casinos in recent months.

In light of these attacks, casino operators are being urged to take steps to improve their security measures. This includes implementing better firewalls and anti-virus protection, as well as ensuring that user access is tightly controlled. Players should also be vigilant when playing online, and ensure that they only use reputable casinos that have a strong security record.
