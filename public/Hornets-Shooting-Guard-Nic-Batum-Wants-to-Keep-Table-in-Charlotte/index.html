        <h1 id="Hornets-Shooting-Guard-Nic-Batum-Wants-to-Keep-Table-in-Charlotte"><a href="#Hornets-Shooting-Guard-Nic-Batum-Wants-to-Keep-Table-in-Charlotte" class="headerlink" title="Hornets Shooting Guard Nic Batum Wants to Keep Table in Charlotte"></a>Hornets Shooting Guard Nic Batum Wants to Keep Table in Charlotte</h1><p>When asked about his thoughts on the future of the Charlotte Hornets, shooting guard Nic Batum made it clear that he wanted to keep the team’s current nucleus together, including the team’s dinner table.</p>
<p>“I want to keep the table,” said Batum. “We have a good thing going. We’re like a family.”</p>
<p>The Frenchman then went on to talk about his love for Charlotte and how much the city has meant to him and his family over the past few years.</p>
<p>“Charlotte is my home now,” Batum said. “I’m happy here and I want to stay here.”</p>
<p>Batum, who is set to become a free agent this summer, had strong praise for Hornets head coach Steve Clifford as well.</p>
<p>“Coach Cliff is unbelievable,” said Batum. “He knows how to get the most out of his players. He’s a great coach and I want to play for him for many years to come.”</p>
<p>When asked if he had any other comments about his future, Batum reiterated his desire to remain in Charlotte.</p>
<p>“I just want to stay here in Charlotte,” Batum said. “I love it here.”</p>
<h1 id="Hornets-Remain-Committed-to-Keeping-Table-in-Charlotte"><a href="#Hornets-Remain-Committed-to-Keeping-Table-in-Charlotte" class="headerlink" title="Hornets Remain Committed to Keeping Table in Charlotte"></a>Hornets Remain Committed to Keeping Table in Charlotte</h1><p>The Charlotte Hornets remain committed to keeping the team in Charlotte and have been in contact with the NBA about ways to improve the situation, the team announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>Public financing for a new arena has not materialized and there’s been no progress made on a possible sale of the team, leaving the future of the Hornets in doubt. The team could be forced to leave Charlotte if a new arena is not built.</p>
<p>“We remain steadfast in our commitment to Charlotte,” Hornets chairman Michael Jordan said in a statement. “We are confident that we can find a resolution that meets all of our criteria, including being good for the city, good for our fans and good for our sponsor partners.”</p>
<p>The Hornets averaged 17,500 fans per game at Spectrum Center this season, ranking 23rd out of 30 teams.</p>
<h1 id="Keeping-the-Table-in-Charlotte-Key-for-Hornets-This-Season"><a href="#Keeping-the-Table-in-Charlotte-Key-for-Hornets-This-Season" class="headerlink" title="Keeping the Table in Charlotte Key for Hornets This Season"></a>Keeping the Table in Charlotte Key for Hornets This Season</h1><p>The Hornets come into the 2017-2018 season with many question marks. Can Kemba Walker and Dwight Howard lead the team to the playoffs? Will Nicolas Batum continue his All-Star level play? Will Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Marvin Williams return to their pre-injury form?</p>
<p>These questions will be answered throughout the season, but one thing is for sure: the Hornets need their veteran players to step up. Specifically, the team will rely on Tony Parker, Cody Zeller, and Jeremy Lamb to provide consistency and stability.</p>
<p>Tony Parker is entering his 18th NBA season and will serve as the team’s backup point guard. He has been a part of six championship teams and brings playoff experience and leadership to Charlotte. At 36 years old, Parker is no longer a superstar player, but he can still contribute in meaningful ways. In 2016-2017 with the Spurs, Parker averaged 7.7 points and 3.5 assists in 18 minutes per game. He shot 49% from the field and 36% from three point range.</p>
<p>Cody Zeller had a breakout year in 2016-2017, averaging 10.3 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. He is a solid rebounder and screen setter who can also score around the basket. Zeller’s emergence as a top player on the Hornets was crucial for the team last season; they will need him to continue his strong play this year if they hope to make the playoffs.</p>
<p>Jeremy Lamb had an inconsistent year in 2016-2017, but showed flashes of being a solid contributor off the bench. He averaged 9.7 points per game on 45% shooting from the field and 34% shooting from three point range. If Lamb can consistently produce at this level, he will be a major asset for Charlotte off the bench.</p>
<p>The Hornets’ success this season will hinge on whether or not their veteran players can step up and contribute consistently. If Tony Parker, Cody Zeller, and Jeremy Lamb can provide leadership and production, Charlotte should be able to make it into the playoffs for the second consecutive season</p>
<h1 id="Hornets-Will-Keep-Table-If-They-Make-Playoffs"><a href="#Hornets-Will-Keep-Table-If-They-Make-Playoffs" class="headerlink" title="Hornets Will Keep Table If They Make Playoffs"></a>Hornets Will Keep Table If They Make Playoffs</h1><p>The Charlotte Hornets are currently sitting in the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference with a record of 35-40. They have seven games left on their schedule, and they need to win four of them in order to clinch a playoff berth.</p>
<p>There’s no question that the Hornets want to make the playoffs. They made it last year, and they don’t want to miss out this year. But there’s also no question that it’s going to be a tough road ahead.</p>
<p>Their next two games are against the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Toronto Raptors - two of the best teams in the league. They then have games against the Brooklyn Nets, the Miami Heat, and the Atlanta Hawks - three teams that are all fighting for playoff spots themselves.</p>
<p>If they can win four out of those seven games, they’ll clinch a playoff berth. But it’s not going to be easy, and there’s definitely no guarantee that they’ll make it.</p>
<h1 id="Hornets-Believe-They-Can-Win-with-Table-in-Charlotte"><a href="#Hornets-Believe-They-Can-Win-with-Table-in-Charlotte" class="headerlink" title="Hornets Believe They Can Win with Table in Charlotte"></a>Hornets Believe They Can Win with Table in Charlotte</h1><p>The Charlotte Hornets believe they can win a championship with their current roster. The Hornets have made the playoffs in two of the last three seasons, but they have been eliminated in the first round both times.<br>On paper, the Hornets don’t look like they should be a contender for a championship, but they believe they can compete with anybody.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a really good team,” said Kemba Walker. “We’ve just got to put it all together and I think we can make some noise.”</p>
<p>The Hornets were one of the most improved teams in the NBA last season, and they believe they can take another step forward this season.</p>
<p> Nic Batum is one of the players who believes in the Hornets’ ability to win a championship.</p>
<p>“I think we can do it,” said Batum. “We just need to stay together, stay healthy and play as hard as we can.”</p>
<p>The Hornets have a lot of talent, and they are led by their All-Star point guard Kemba Walker. Walker is one of the most dynamic players in the NBA, and he is capable of scoring 30 points on any given night.</p>
<p>Walker is supported by a talented cast of players including Nicolas Batum, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Jeremy Lamb and Cody Zeller. These players all bring something different to the table, and that could be enough to propel the Hornets to the NBA Finals.</p>
<p>The Charlotte Hornets are often overlooked because of the other teams in the Eastern Conference,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> but they are confident that they can compete with anyone. They have a strong roster that is capable of winning a championship, and they are determined to bring a title home to Charlotte.</p>
