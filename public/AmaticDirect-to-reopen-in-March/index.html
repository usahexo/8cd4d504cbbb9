<p>The company closed its doors in November of 2018, citing the need to restructure their business model to better accommodate the needs of their clients.</p>
<p>CEO and Founder of AmaticDirect, Stephan Jaklitsch had this to say: \&quot;We\&#39;re excited to reopen our doors and continue serving our clients with the same level of excellence they\&#39;ve come to expect from us.\&quot;</p>
<p>Since closing, the company has put in place a number of changes, including a new pricing model, more streamlined production processes, and a revamped customer service approach. These changes are aimed at making it easier for customers to get the products they need when they need them.</p>
<p>In addition to the changes made to the company itself, AmaticDirect has also partnered with several other companies to offer expanded services and products. These partnerships will give customers access to a wider range of printed products and services than ever before.</p>
<p>All these changes have been implemented with one goal in mind: To provide the best possible experience for AmaticDirect\&#39;s clients. The company is confident that these changes will not only make AmaticDirect more competitive but also improve customer satisfaction levels.</p>
<p>March 2019 is just around the corner so be sure to keep an eye on AmaticDirect for all your printing needs!</p>

<p>The rebuild has been a long and arduous process, with many setbacks along the way, but now things are all ready to go and the first day of business is scheduled for next Monday.</p>
<p>The new building has been completely redesigned and modernized, with updated equipment and a larger printing area. The management team is the same as before, so customers can expect the same high quality products and service they have come to know and love.</p>
<p>In a statement, CEO Jan Lepoch said: “We would like to thank our loyal customers for their patience over these last few years. We know it has been difficult not having access to our services, but we can assure you that it has been worth the wait. The new AmaticDirect is bigger and better than ever before, so please come and visit us soon.”</p>

<p>In addition to the new design, AmaticDirect will also be launching several new games in September. These include:</p>

<p>— Royal Crown: An exciting table game which lets players experience the excitement of a real casino atmosphere from the comfort of their own home. Royal Crown combines classic blackjack gameplay with some unique twists, such as double down options and splitting hands.</p>
<p>— Crown &amp; Anchor: Another table game based on a classic casino favourite. Crown &amp; Anchor offers players the chance to bet on either Red or Black, or to bet on whether the next card will be higher or lower than the first card dealt. With stakes starting from just 10p per go, this game is perfect for players of all budgets!</p>
<p>The launch of these new games coincides with the reopening of AmaticDirect Casino and promises to provide players with hours of entertainment!</p>

<h1 id="AmaticDirect-casino-set-to-reopen-soon-with-improved-security"><a href="#AmaticDirect-casino-set-to-reopen-soon-with-improved-security" class="headerlink" title="AmaticDirect casino set to reopen soon with improved security"></a>AmaticDirect casino set to reopen soon with improved security</h1><p>Casino operators have been on high alert recently, as a number of well-known brands have become the target of cybercriminals. In response to this, many operators are taking steps to improve their security measures. One such casino is AmaticDirect, which is set to reopen its doors soon with improved security in place.</p>
<p>AmaticDirect Casino was forced to close its doors in early 2018 after it fell victim to a cyber attack. The casino has now confirmed that it will reopen soon, with a number of new security measures in place. These include enhanced firewalls and anti-virus protection, as well as additional controls on user access.</p>
<p>In a statement, the casino operator said: “We recognise that our players are our top priority and we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure their safety and security when playing at AmaticDirect Casino. We apologise for any inconvenience caused by the closure of our site and we look forward to welcoming our players back soon.”</p>
<p>The AmaticDirect Casino breach came just weeks after another major casino suffered a similar attack. The hacking group known as “Russian Troll Factory” targeted Liberty Slots Casino, stealing player data and causing significant financial damage. It is believed that this group is behind a number of other attacks on casinos in recent months.</p>
<p>In light of these attacks, casino operators are being urged to take steps to improve their security measures. This includes implementing better firewalls and anti-virus protection, as well as ensuring that user access is tightly controlled. Players should also be vigilant when playing online, and ensure that they only use reputable casinos that have a strong security record.</p>
