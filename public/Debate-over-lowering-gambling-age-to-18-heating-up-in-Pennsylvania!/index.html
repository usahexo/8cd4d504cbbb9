<p>On one side, lawmakers want to lower the gambling age from 21 to 18 in order to bring in more revenue for the state. They believe that 18-year-olds are mature enough to make responsible decisions about gambling and that this would help create new jobs in the casino industry.</p>
<p>On the other side, some people worry that minors may not be able to handle the temptation of gambling and that it could lead to addiction and other negative consequences. They argue that 21 is an appropriate age for legalized gambling because it allows people time to develop maturity and experience with money management.</p>
<p>So who is right? Is it better to lower the gambling age or keep it at 21? Let’s take a look at both sides of the argument.</p>
<p>Argument for Lowering Gambling Age:</p>
<p>There are several good reasons to support lowering the gambling age from 21 to 18. First, let’s look at the practical benefits. If the law were changed, this would create thousands of new jobs in the casino industry across Pennsylvania. This would not only benefit those who are currently employed in casinos, but also generate new job growth in related businesses like hospitality and tourism. Additionally, by loosening restrictions on gambling for adults, we can help reduce black market activity around casinos and gaming venues. This would provide additional revenue for the state through taxes, while also helping keep our communities safe.</p>
<p>In terms of maturity, there is evidence to suggest that most 18-year-olds are capable of making informed decisions about gambling. After all, they are legally allowed to vote, sign contracts and serve in the military. Gambling is not something that should be taken lightly, but if a person is considered old enough to handle these other responsibilities then they should be considered capable of gambling responsibly as well.</p>
<p>Argument Against Lowering Gambling Age:</p>
<p>While there are benefits to lowering the gambling age, there are also valid concerns that need to be considered. One big issue is addiction – many people believe that minors are more likely to develop addictions to gambling than adults. And since addiction can have serious consequences on a person’s health and wellbeing, it’s important to take measures to protect minors from this risk. Another concern is financial instability – young people may not have as much experience with money management as adults, which could lead them into heavy debt if they start betting recklessly. Finally, some people argue that young adults simply aren’t mature enough yet to handle the temptations and risks associated with legalized gambling. They may make impulsive decisions or become addicted without fully understanding the consequences.</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-considering-whether-to-allow-18-year-olds-to-gamble"><a href="#Indiana-considering-whether-to-allow-18-year-olds-to-gamble" class="headerlink" title="Indiana considering whether to allow 18 year olds to gamble!"></a>Indiana considering whether to allow 18 year olds to gamble!</h1><p>Indiana is one of the states in the US that is currently considering a bill that would allow 18 year olds to gamble in casinos. The main purpose of this bill is to help raise money for the state, as casinos would be required to pay taxes on the money that they make from gambling with people under the age of 21.</p>
<p>This bill has been controversial, as many people believe that it is not safe for young adults to gamble. There are also concerns that allowing 18 year olds to gamble could lead to addiction problems for some people. However, supporters of the bill argue that it is important for young adults to have the opportunity to gamble in a controlled setting, as this can help them learn how to gamble responsibly.</p>
<p>So far, the bill has received approval from both the House and Senate in Indiana, and it is now waiting for approval from Governor Eric Holcomb. If he approves it, then it will become law and 18 year olds will be allowed to gamble in casinos in Indiana.</p>
<h1 id="Iowa-could-become-the-next-state-to-lower-the-gambling-age-to-18"><a href="#Iowa-could-become-the-next-state-to-lower-the-gambling-age-to-18" class="headerlink" title="Iowa could become the next state to lower the gambling age to 18!"></a>Iowa could become the next state to lower the gambling age to 18!</h1><p>Iowa lawmakers say that a vote on a bill to lower the gambling age from 21 to 18 could come as soon as next week. The proposed measure would allow those aged 18 and over to legally gamble in casinos, racinos and at the state’s 19 horse tracks.</p>
<p>“It’s something that we’re looking at,” said Rep. Jake Highfill (R-Johnston). “I think it has a lot of merit.”</p>
<p>Sponsors of the bill say that the change would help generate revenue for the state, which is facing a budget deficit. They also argue that young people are already gambling illegally, so it makes sense to regulate and tax the activity.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill counter that gambling can be addictive and harmful to young people, and that it’s not appropriate for them to be making decisions about spending money on games of chance. They also worry that the availability of gambling will lead to more problem gambling cases.</p>
<p>So far, there doesn’t appear to be much consensus on the issue in Iowa. A poll commissioned by the Des Moines Register in February found that 45 percent of Iowans supported lowering the gambling age, while 44 percent were opposed.</p>
<p>If passed, Iowa would become just the latest state to lower its gambling age. In recent years, both Mississippi and New Hampshire have moved from 21 to 18, while Connecticut lowered its age from 21 to 19.</p>
<h1 id="Debate-over-gambling-age-heats-up-in-Michigan-as-well"><a href="#Debate-over-gambling-age-heats-up-in-Michigan-as-well" class="headerlink" title="Debate over gambling age heats up in Michigan as well!"></a>Debate over gambling age heats up in Michigan as well!</h1><p>A heated debate over the gambling age is currently underway in the state of Michigan. Some lawmakers are pushing to increase the minimum gambling age from 18 to 21, while opponents of the measure argue that such a move would be counterproductive.</p>
<p>To date, there is no federal law governing the minimum gambling age, so each state is free to set its own rules. Currently, there are only a handful of states with a minimum gambling age of 21, while most have set the age at 18.</p>
<p>Supporters of increasing the minimum gambling age in Michigan argue that it would help to protect young people from developing problems with gambling addiction. They maintain that many young people are not emotionally or mentally developed enough to handle the risks associated with gambling, and that increasing the minimum age would help to safeguard their well-being.</p>
<p>Opponents of increasing the minimum gambling age in Michigan counter that doing so would simply push young people into neighbouring states where the minimum age is lower. They also argue that 18-year-olds are legally considered adults and should be allowed to make their own decisions about whether or not to gamble.</p>
<p>So far, no final decision has been made on this issue in Michigan. It will be interesting to see which side prevails in this debate!</p>
<h1 id="New-Hampshire-may-soon-lower-the-gambling-age-to-18-as-well"><a href="#New-Hampshire-may-soon-lower-the-gambling-age-to-18-as-well" class="headerlink" title="New Hampshire may soon lower the gambling age to 18 as well!"></a>New Hampshire may soon lower the gambling age to 18 as well!</h1><p>The state of New Hampshire may soon lower the gambling age from 21 to 18 years old. This is a proposal that’s been brought up to the state house, and it’s currently being considered. There are many people in favor of this change, including casino advocates and lawmakers.</p>
<p>Although there is no set date for when a vote will take place, if it does pass, the new gambling age would go into effect at the beginning of 2020. This would make New Hampshire one of the few states in the country with an age limit of 18 for both casinos and lottery games.</p>
<p>The main reason for wanting to lower the gambling age is to attract more young people to casinos. Lawmakers believe that if the gambling age is lowered, more 18-20 year olds will visit casinos and spend money there. And since casinos already exist in New Hampshire, there is no need to wait for new ones to open; this would be a way to increase revenue immediately.</p>
<p>When it comes to lotteries, lawmakers believe that 18 year olds are mature enough to make responsible choices about whether or not to play them. They also note that many other states have lower gambling ages, and that this has not led to any major problems.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no opposition to the proposed change in New Hampshire. However, it’s still possible that some groups could speak out against it before it’s voted on. We’ll have to wait and see what happens!</p>
